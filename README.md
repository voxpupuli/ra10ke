| puppetfile_name | The Puppetfile name (Default: basedir/Puppetfile)                                             |

## Rake tasks

### r10k:syntax

Syntax check for the Puppetfile. Similar to the `r10k puppetfile check`
command.

### r10k:dependencies

This rake task goes through the modules that are declared in the Puppetfile,
and prints outdated modules.

Supports:
  - Puppet Forge
  - Git (SHA-ref and Tagging)

Ignoring specific modules:

Under specific conditions you may not wish to report on specific modules being out of date,
to ignore a module create `.r10kignore` file in the same directory as your Puppetfile.

### r10k:solve_dependencies

Reads the Puppetfile in the current directory and uses the ruby 'solve' library to find
missing and outdated dependencies based on their metadata.

The solver does not allow major version bumps according to SemVer by default. To allow
major upgrades, call the rake task with any parameter.

The rake task will download git modules into the modules/ directory to access their metadata.json.
It will also cache forge metadata in ̃$XDG_CACHE_DIR/ra10ke.metadata_cache in order to make subsequent
runs faster.

### r10k:install[path]

Reads the Puppetfile in the current directory and installs them under the `path` provided as an argument.

#### Limitations

  * It works only with modules from the [Forge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com), and Git.
  SVN modules will be ignored.
  * Git support is explicitly SHA Ref and Tag supported. If tag is used it must follow
  `v0.0.0` convention, other wise it will be ignored.
  * The version has to be specified explicitly. If it is omitted, or it is
  `:latest`, the module will be ignored.
  
### r10k:validate[path]
The validate rake task will determine if the url is a valid url by connecting 
to the repository and verififying it actually exists and can be accessed.
Additional if a branch, tag, or ref is specified in the Puppetfile the validate
task will also verify that that branch/tag/ref exists in the remote repository.

If you have ever deployed r10k to production only to find out a tag or branch is
missing this validate task will catch that issue.  

A exit status of 0 is returned if there are no faults, while a 1 is returned if
any module has a bad status. 

Status emojis can be customized by setting the following environment variables.

Example

 * `GOOD_EMOJI='👍'`
 * `BAD_EMOJI='😨'`
